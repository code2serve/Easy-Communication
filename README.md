Easy Communication App

Dear Friends,

Thanks a lot for your support to special children and also your kind words and blessings to all of us at Vasantham.

It means a lot to us.

I have shared existing code for "Easy Communication" at, 

https://github.com/natahere/EasyCommunication

My system crashed last month and I lost code of all my apps. Unfortunately, I did not have back up as well. I have tried some means to get the code back from .apk file.

Somehow I have managed to get back the code base for this app again.

Changes/Improvements to be made:

Layout - Currently am using a LinearLayout for the actions - Needs to be changed to RelativeLayout or any other layouts that team feels is good.
Settings App - The launch screen has two square boxes, definitely can be designed better.
Camera - am still using Camera and NOT camera2, needs change
Also, the way to capture image and display is a lot of code, if that can be improved, please do help.
If we can revamp the entire thing, am okay with that as well.

Need your opinion:

I have created a separate google account called - code2serve@gmail.com I would like to create a separate developer account for this and would want to get the developer license for this. I thought any changes we make and any new apps we make should go to this common ID. As a token of love, I would like to get this license cost on myself and have all of us work on this account - ONLY on apps for social cause .

I also got request from professionals that the app can be made with Video View for person with Aphasia. So we may have many more such apps to work with - apps for children in rural areas, education related apps etc. or any idea that you all bring in. 

Is this idea fine? If you feel it is fine, I will get the developer account and update you all.

Once again, thanks a lot for your support.

Regards,
Natarajan
